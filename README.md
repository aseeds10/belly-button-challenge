# Project Title
Rutgers Bootcamp Challenge 14 - JavaScript Dashboard & Belly Button Biodiversity

## Description
Prompt: Build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset(http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), 
which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, 
while the rest were relatively rare.

## Installation
1. Plotly library for Javascript (<script src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js"></script>)
2. D3 library for Javascript (<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>)

## Acknowledgments
- Used Xpert Learning Assistant for assistance debugging and with template (ex. for bubble chart using plotly for Java).
